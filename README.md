#Description - 
This project is a Speech Recognition System simulated in Tinkercad, designed to control a bulb using voice commands such as "ON" and "OFF".

Working:
1. In a real-world scenario, a speech recognition module (like V3) would process voice commands and send signals to control the bulb. However, since Tinkercad does not support the V3 module directly, we use serial communication as an alternative.
2. The Arduino Uno receives input commands ("ON" or "OFF") through the serial monitor, simulating the speech recognition module's function.
3. Based on the received command, the Arduino controls the bulb, turning it ON or OFF accordingly.
4. A resistor is used to limit current and ensure proper circuit operation.
This project demonstrates basic home automation, serial communication, and Arduino-based control systems, making it a practical introduction to speech-controlled devices.
